# Biblio NFT Collection Minter DApp
![dapp cover image with books](./src/assets/img/cover.png "BiblioNFT Collection")

This is a DApp for Minting Biblio NFT Collection. Built on Celo with Hardhat and React and metadata hosted on IPFS.

You can find the [Demo here](https://aishat-akinyemi.github.io/BiblioNFT-DAPP/)

This DApp displays the Biblio NFT Collection. I have included a [sample Marketplace contract here ](https://github.com/Aishat-Akinyemi/BiblioNFT-DAPP/blob/master/contracts/BiblioMarketPlace.sol) which can be used to build a marketplace DApp for the Collection (or any ERC721) token collection.










This MemeMarketplace dapp was created as my submission to Celo Challenge on Dacade. [Join dacade](https://dacade.org/signup?invite=aishatakinyemi) to not just learn how to build blockchain solutions, but earn while you do so.
